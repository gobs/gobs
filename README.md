Gobs of Go

## Introduction

This is a collection of useful Go packages, that should make life a little easier
for developers coming from other languages and/or with a common set of requirements.

Each package is hosted in its own repository, to keep the import path short and can be used independently of each other.

The current list of available packages is:

* [httpclient](//github.com/gobs/httpclient) : A friendly HTTP client, inspired by python 'requests'
* [cmd](//github.com/gobs/cmd) : A package to write shell-like application, inspired by python cmd/cmd2
* [args](//github.com/gobs/args) : A simple command line argument parser
* [pretty](//github.com/gobs/pretty) : A pretty-printer for Go data structures

Also here:

* [readline](//github.com/gobs/readline) : A fork of [sbinet/go-readline](https://github.com/sbinet/go-readline) with completion and Windows support
* [simplejson](//github.com/gobs/simplejson) : A fork of [bitly/go-simplejson](https://github.com/bitly/go-simplejson)
